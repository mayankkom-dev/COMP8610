[Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mayankkom-dev/COMP8610/blob/main/Assignment02_NNDL_pyTorch.ipynb)</p>
The repo includ interactive colab notebook implementation of below assignment questions using pytorch. The notebook has proper layout and headings to talk along the journey of assignment.
### Question #1 
Download the benchmark dataset MNIST from http://yann.lecun.com/ exdb/mnist/. Implement multiclass logistic regression and try it on MNIST. 
### Question #2 
Run the regularized multiclass logistic regression on MNIST, using the basic minibatch SGD, and compare its results to those of the basic minibatch SGD with non-regularized loss, in Question #1.
### Question #3 
Investigate the basic minibatch SGD with, at least, another regularization method discussed in class here - early stopping, dropout
